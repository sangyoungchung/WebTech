    <hr>
    <p>Because of the spice that is included in the Vietnamese food (cilantro), South Koreans were not the big fan of Vietnamese cuisine. Recently, many young millennials adopts foreign flavors which made Vietnamese cuisine popular in South Korea. Personally, I tried many Vietnamese food, but I do not think they have decent taste that made me to try again. However, Le Hoi made me to go again. Even though this restaurant located in the middle of the hill which is hard to visit, many people take that risk to climb the hill to taste this Vietnamese food.  </p>
