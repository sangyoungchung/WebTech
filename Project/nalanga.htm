    <p>I did not go to all of the Michelin's guide recommend Japanese restaurant in South Korea, but Nalan-ga is way better than other fine sushi restaurant that I visited. Many decent Japanese restaurant listed Toro sushi price at least $30 for single menu. However, Nalanga set their Toro sushi as $25 per set. Not only Toro sushi set but also house special set is amazing. Chef of the Nalanga sushi brings a fixed quantity of seasonal fishes from fishery, so you can try many different seasonal sushi. Due to limited capacity, waiting will be needed, so plan ahead if you are going with many friends.
